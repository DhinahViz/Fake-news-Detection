📰 Fake News Detector
Your AI-powered truth checker for news articles!

👋 Welcome!
Have you ever wondered if a news article you read is real or fake? With so much information floating around online, it's hard to know what's trustworthy. That’s why I built this project — a Fake News Detector that uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to help spot fake news with just a click!

💡 What This Project Does
👉 This web app lets users paste any news content, and it instantly tells whether the news is REAL or FAKE.
👉 It’s trained using real datasets of news articles — no guesswork, just solid AI logic!
👉 It's smart, fast, and super easy to use — all built with Python and a clean web interface using tkinter.

📚 What I Used
Python – for all the backend logic

Pandas & Numpy – for handling the data

TfidfVectorizer – to convert text into numbers

Logistic Regression – my ML model of choice

tkinter – to create the web app

Joblib – to save and load my model

NLTK – for basic text cleaning

📊 Model Performance
After training the model, here’s how it performed:

✅ Accuracy: 98.8%

🔍 It predicts REAL and FAKE news almost perfectly

📈 Balanced precision, recall, and f1-score

📂 Dataset Info
I used two datasets:

Fake.csv – News that’s fake

Real.csv – News from trusted sources

I merged them and trained my model on thousands of real-world articles.
